Welcome to Pujo Atlas - your ultimate guide for Pandal Hopping during Durga Puja in Kolkata! This open-source project aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly webapp that lists all the Durga Pujas happening around Kolkata and offers a host of features to make your pandal hopping experience seamless and enjoyable.

## Our Trending Pandals Algorithm

1. **Initialize Venues**

   - For each venue, set:
     - `score = 100`
     - `score_floor = 0`
     - `updated_at = current_time`
     - `last_score = 0` (initially no score change)

2. **Search Result Click Handling**

   - When a user clicks on a venue (e.g., venue B):
     - Increment `score` of the clicked venue (B):
       - `B.score += 2`
       - `B.last_score += 2` (increment reflects the change)
     - Decrement `score` of other venues (A, C):
       - `A.score -= 1`
       - `A.last_score -= 1` (decrement reflects the change)
       - `C.score -= 1`
       - `C.last_score -= 1` (decrement reflects the change)
     - Set `B.updated_at = current_time`

3. **Direction/Navigation Button Click Handling**

   - When a user clicks on the direction/navigation button for a venue (e.g., venue D):
     - Increment `D.score`:
       - `D.score += 3`
       - `D.last_score += 3` (increment reflects the change)
     - Set `D.updated_at = current_time`

4. **Breaking Ties on Score**

   - If venues have the same score:
     - Sort by `updated_at` (most recent positive activity).
     - Increment the score of the most recently updated venue by 1:
       - `most_recent_venue.score += 1`
       - `most_recent_venue.last_score += 1` (increment reflects the change)

5. **Time-Based Exploration Logic**

   - For each venue, check the time since the last update:
     - If `current_time - venue.updated_at > X hours`:
       - Calculate `positive_updates_count` in the last `2X hours`.
       - For each positive update in this period, decrement the score:
         - `venue.score -= positive_updates_count`
         - `venue.last_score -= positive_updates_count` (decrement reflects the change)
       - Ensure `venue.score` does not go below `score_floor`:
         - `if venue.score < venue.score_floor: venue.score = venue.score_floor`

6. **Repeat Steps as Necessary**
   - Continuously monitor and update scores based on user interactions and the time elapsed since the last update.
