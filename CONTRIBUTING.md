## Code Quality & Commits

- **Linting:** ESLint is enforced in CI.
- **Formatting:** Prettier is enforced in CI.
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript errors will block PRs.
- **UI/UX:** Every component mush be mobile responsive unless stated otherwise.
- **Commit Messages:** Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Feature Flags & Custom Properties

- Store all feature flag and custom property names in a single enum (TypeScript) or const object (JavaScript).
- Never hardcode API keys or sensitive valuesâ€”use environment variables (see `.env.example`).
- If a feature flag or custom property is referenced in multiple places, use a shared enum/const object to avoid duplication and ensure consistency.

---

## Component & File Organization

- Place reusable UI in `src/components/ui/`.
- Use `src/constants/` for enums, config, and shared values.
- Utilities go in `src/lib/`.
- Static assets in `public/`.

---

## Testing & Manual QA

- Manual functional testing is required before submitting a PR.
- Automated tests are not present, but CI will enforce build, lint, and typecheck.

---

## Pull Requests

- PR must be created from `dev` branch and PR should be raised against the `dev` branch unless stated otherwise
- Use the provided PR template.
- Fill out all sections, including testing steps and screenshots if UI is affected.
- All PRs must pass CI (lint, format, typecheck, build) before merge.
- Manual testing is required before submitting.
